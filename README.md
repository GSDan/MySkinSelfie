## What is MySkinSelfie?
Developed by Newcastle University's Openlab in collaboration with Consultant Dermatologist Dr Philip Hampton, MySkinSelfie makes it easier to keep track of how your skin conditions change over time.

By helping you take consistent photographs of your skin through an overlay system, MySkinSelfie is a great tool to use to keep track of the progress of your skin conditions. Keep your photos organised by date, condition type and location on your body and track how they change over time through notes and the handy comparison tool. The images you take are stored in the cloud over a secure connection, meaning you can access them across multiple devices for years to come - perfect for long-term condition tracking!

All uploaded files are encrypted, meaning that you can be safe in the knowledge that no-one will get their hands on your sensitive images. Photos are kept out of your device's default image gallery and you even have the option to lock the application behind a PIN, preventing any potential embarrassment!
